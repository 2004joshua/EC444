### Summary

I connected a thermistor on a breadboard using jumper wires for connections, essentially utilizing it as a variable resistor. By replacing the fixed resistor originally connected to the 3.3V line, I then used a jumper wire to connect one of the AC pins for voltage measurement. This setup allowed me to observe and measure voltage changes corresponding to the thermistor's varying resistance, demonstrating its functionality in the circuit configuration.
