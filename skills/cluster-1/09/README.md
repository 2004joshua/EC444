### Summary

I recently swapped out the thermistor in my circuit with a photocell and maintained one jumper wire connected to the analog pin. Initially, the voltage readings were lower in the darker room conditions, reflecting the higher resistance of the photocell in low light. However, upon introducing additional light sources, the voltage readings promptly increased. This adjustment demonstrates the photocell's sensitivity to ambient light levels, showcasing its role as a responsive light sensor in the circuit setup.

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
