### Summary

To create a digital stopwatch on the ESP32 using timer interrupts, you'll utilize the microcontroller's timer and GPIO functionalities. Setting up a GPIO pin for button detection, you'll manage start and reset actions for the stopwatch. A timer interrupt handler will increment a seconds counter, displayed on an alphanumeric screen connected to the ESP32. This project emphasizes efficient hardware interaction and precise timekeeping through interrupt-driven timer operations on the ESP32 platform.
