### Summary

This skill involves resetting and configuring a router for proper network management and remote access through Dynamic DNS (DDNS). We connected the laptop to the router via a LAN port or Wi-Fi, reset it by holding the reset button for 30 seconds, and logged in using the default credentials (root/admin) at http://192.168.1.1. We ensured the DHCP server was active, changed the SSID to Group_7, and set WPA2 Personal security with the shared key smartsys. Additionally, we configured the time zone and NTP server, updated the router password to smart, and saved the settings. Finally, we explored the device list to monitor connected devices, preparing the router for DDNS to maintain access despite changing IPs.
