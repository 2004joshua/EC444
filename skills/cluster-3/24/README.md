### Summary

The purpose of this skill was to set up a Raspberry Pi camera to stream video over a network and view the stream on a remote client. I started by attaching the camera to the Raspberry Pi and enabling it through the configuration utility. After verifying the cameraâ€™s functionality using rpicam-hello, I used the libcamera-vid command to stream video to a specified network address and port. The stream was tested locally on the Raspberry Pi using VLC and remotely on my laptop by connecting to the network stream. This process demonstrated how to leverage the Raspberry Pi as a low-cost video streaming device for applications like surveillance or IoT projects.

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
