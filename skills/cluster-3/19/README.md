### Summary

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) ensures remote access to devices despite changing IPs by linking a domain name (e.g., myserver.ddns.net) to the latest IP. With routers assigning local IPs, port forwarding maps external traffic (e.g., :1131) to internal devices (e.g., 192.168.1.103:80). This skill involves setting up a Node.js server, configuring DDNS and port forwarding on the router, and accessing the server remotely using the DDNS address.
