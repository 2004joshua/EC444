### Summary

There wasn't really much to this skill, I made a finite state machine for this skill and it was made to display the different states a gasoline station has. When its just there the state is idle but once the user says how much gas they want and how much money they have on hand it authorizes the user where the gasoline station begins to pump gas for a set amount of time. once it finishes it returns back to its idle state, just for functionality I programmed it just to be able to leave the program if certain conditions are met.
