### Summary

The Leader (Coordinator) Election skill involves implementing the Bully Algorithm to elect a leader in a distributed system. The goal is to ensure that only one leader is elected at any given time, all devices recognize the leader, and a new leader is elected if the current leader fails. The algorithm involves devices exchanging messages to decide the leader, ensuring that the election process completes in a finite time.

In this skill, devices communicate via UDP to exchange election messages. Each device runs the same code, transitioning through states such as leader, follower, and timeout. The system uses LEDs to indicate the deviceâ€™s current state, with blue representing the leader, green for followers, and red for timeout situations. The Bully Algorithm ensures that if the leader fails, a new election is triggered, and a new leader is chosen.

The goal is to demonstrate a functioning system where multiple devices boot up, elect a leader, handle leader failure and recovery, and display the new leader. This skill showcases fault tolerance and distributed decision-making, with a focus on managing leader elections in real-time.
