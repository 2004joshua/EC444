### Summary

In this skill I connected the LEDS to an ESP32 using the diagrams we were given in the quest directory. I utilized the MOSI, MISO, SCL, and SDA pins to control the input into the LEDs. I created two functions that utilized premade functions to control the input into the LEDs.  
In this project, I connected LEDs to an ESP32 using the MOSI, MISO, SCL, and SDA pins, following the provided diagrams. I created two functions that controlled the LED behavior by using ESP-IDF's built-in functions for setting pin modes and managing input signals. Initially, I used VSCode, but after encountering bugs, I switched to the CLI to compile and flash the code. Once I set up the environment on the CLI, everything worked smoothly.
