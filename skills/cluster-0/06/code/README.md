## In the LED-Lightup code I did the following:
- init_pins() initializes the LEDS using gpio_set_direction()
- set_pins() inputs a 1 or a 0 to turn a light on or off using gpio_set_level() to turn them on or off 
- In the main I initialized then I put in the order of turning the LEDs on and off basing it off the instructions we were given on the github 

## In Blink code I did the following: 
- Changed the gpio from what it was originally to 13 since it corresponded with the blinking lights
