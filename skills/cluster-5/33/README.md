### Summary

So basically what we did was just make the car go to one coordinate point and just stop, the goal of this skill was to make the car go as straight as possible having an algorithm that fixes itself each time the error angle goes over 5 or less than -5 degrees. we used the code provided as a foundation for the quest and saw success in making the car go straight. Also note we didnt video this because once this worked we went straight to the quest after this moment.

### AI and Open Source Code Assertions

- I have documented in my code readme.md and in my code any
software that we have adopted from elsewhere
- I used AI for coding and this is documented in my code as
indicated by comments "AI generated"
